# Python Programming MOOC 2024 - Robot Game Project
This repository contains my final project in the University of Helsinki's Python Programming MOOC 2024. The instructions
for this exercise can be found here https://programming-23.mooc.fi/part-14/4-your-own-game.

## Game Design

The game will have the following design:

- The player controls a robot in a tile based map
- The map is procedurally generated using a maze-generation algorithm. The corridors will be at least 4-5 tiles wide.
- Monsters will be placed throughout the map, and will move about randomly every second or so, or every time the player 
moves which might be easier to code.
- The player must reach the door to win the game.
- The score given is the number of coins collected
- There will be a menu screen and a end screen, the latter tells the player how well they scored.
